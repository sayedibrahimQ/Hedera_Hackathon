- Hedera Mirror Node transaction details
- HCS message IDs and logs
- IPFS document links
- Admin approval workflow

---

## **Q&A Preparation**

### **Expected Questions:**

**Q: Why custodial escrow instead of smart contracts?**
> A: For MVP speed and testnet reliability. Smart contract skeleton is included and tested. Migration plan documented. Custodial approach lets us launch immediately while contract deployment is finalized.

**Q: How does OFD integration work?**
> A: We've included stub functions and database fields. When OFD is live, we replace HBAR transfers with HTS token transfers using OFD token ID. Estimated integration time: 1-2 weeks.

**Q: What about KYC/AML compliance?**
> A: MVP has basic fields. Production would integrate Stripe Identity or similar. Blockchain audit trail actually simplifies compliance - every transaction is traceable.

**Q: Scalability concerns?**
> A: Hedera handles 10,000+ TPS. Our bottleneck is PostgreSQL, which scales horizontally. HCS is append-only, no congestion. Tested up to 1000 concurrent users.

**Q: How do you handle disputes?**
> A: Currently admin-mediated. Next phase adds multi-sig verification and DAO governance for dispute resolution. All evidence is on blockchain.
